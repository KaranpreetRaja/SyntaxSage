# Planning Document

## Iteration 1
- **Syntax Testing: insert user story here. Priority: high. Cost: 8 days.**
  - Test Syntax: Implement the main functionality of the app, test users knowledge of a given language's syntax by offering multiple types of problems (fill in the blank, drag and drop, etc). Utilize inheritance, have a question ancestor that splits off into different forms of questions.
- **View Progress: insert user story here. Priority: high. Cost: 7 days.**
  - Implement functionality that allows user to view syntax learning progress in Swing-based GUI, avoid clutter and ensure the best visual experience for the user.
- **User Database: insert user story here. Priority: medium. Cost: 5 days.**
  - Create a database to store user progress and achievements, and tailor problems to user's preferences. Store locally on SQLite, and remotely on MongoDB to allow user to practice from multiple devices.
- **Learning Pages: insert user story here. Priority: medium. Cost: 3 days.**
  - Display "Learning Pages", which give the user important documentation pertinent to the language they are learning. Show this information in a seperate window.
- **Badges and Awards: insert user story here. Priority: low. Cost: 2 days.**
  - Create a reward system to celebrate progress, by awarding the user badges to display on their profile. Assign users badges based on their current fluency in a programming languages syntax.
- **Progress Bar: insert user story here. Priority: low. Cost: 1 day.**
  - Implement a progress bar on the home screen of the application to supplement the progress section, by giving the user a quick way to view their completion in the course at a glance.
