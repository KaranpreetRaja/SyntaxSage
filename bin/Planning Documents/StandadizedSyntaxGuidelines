Standadized Syntax Guidelines to follow when working on this project:

- camel case (no spaces, the first letter is not capital, all other words have a capital first letter) for variables and methods
- pascal case for classes
- when using abbreviations (ex acc for Account), comment full word first-time variable or method is declared
- use "this." keyword in front of all instance variables
- space out curly brackets such that they each occupy a single line (thus methods are not to be declared in a single line)
- instance variables are all declared at the top
- constructors are the first method/s declared
- setters and getters have the following prefixes: "set" and "get"
