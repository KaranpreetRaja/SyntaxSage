# Development Guidelines
These below are the rules that must be followed when developing code for our codebase
## Github Specifications
### Commits
- Commits must have a clear Title and Discription
### Branch Naming Convention
When creating branches, please follow the following convention: `Name-FeatureUnderDevelopment`
- The naming convention consists of two parts, the name of the person working on the branch and the feature that is being implemented in that branch
- ex. "Karan-LoginPage"

## Code Specifications
### Variables/Methods: 
- camel case (no spaces/underlines/hyphens, the first letter is not capital, all other words have a capital first letter)
- when using abbreviations (ex acc for Account), comment full word first-time variable or method is declared
- use "this." keyword in front of all instance variables
- space out curly brackets such that they each occupy a single line (thus methods are not to be declared in a single line)
- instance variables are all declared at the top
- constructors are the first method/s declared
- setters and getters have the following prefixes: "set" and "get"
### Classes:
