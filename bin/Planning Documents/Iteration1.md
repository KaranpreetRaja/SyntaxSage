# Iteration 1
- **Syntax Testing: As a user, I want to be able to test my knowledge of the syntax of a programming language, so I can assess my understanding and identify areas for improvement. Priority: high. Cost: 8 days.**
  - Test Syntax: Implement the main functionality of the app, test users knowledge of a given language's syntax by offering multiple types of problems (fill in the blank, drag and drop, etc). Utilize inheritance, have a question ancestor that splits off into different forms of questions. Priority: high. Cost: 8 days.
- **View Progress: As a user, I want to be able to view how much progress I have completed in the course where I am learning the syntax of a new programming language. Priority: high. Cost: 7 days.**
  - Show Progress Screen: Implement functionality that allows user to view syntax learning progress in Swing-based GUI, avoid clutter and ensure the best visual experience for the user. Priority: high. Cost: 7 days.
  - Progress Bar: Implement a progress bar on the home screen of the application to supplement the progress section, by giving the user a quick way to view their completion in the course at a glance. Priority: low. Cost: 1 day.
- **Learning Pages: As a user, I want to be able to view a programming language's documentation at a glance to learn more about what a method might do, while I am learning. I also want to be able to highlight certain notes and save them for later, to view them quicker. Priority: medium. Cost: 3 days.**
  - Display "Learning Pages": Give the user important documentation pertinent to the language they are learning. Show this information in a seperate window. Priority: medium. Cost: 2 days.
  - Save Notes: Allow the user to save specified elements of the documentation to look at later. Store saved notes in a seperate tab. Priority: low. Cost: 1 day.
- **Badges and Awards: As a user, I want to be able to feel rewarded for my progress to push me to keep learning a given programming languages syntax. Priority: low. Cost: 2 days.**
  - Badges: Create a reward system to celebrate progress, by awarding the user badges to display on their profile. Assign users badges based on their current fluency in a programming languages syntax. Priority: low. Cost: 1 day.
  - Awards: Give the user a "Hot Streak" award appropriate to how many questions they've solved in a row. Priority: low. Cost: 1 day.

## Iteration 2
- **User Database: As a user, I would need my own account where all my progress and achievements will be tailored to my preferences. I would also like to learn and practice on other devices as well. Priority: medium. Cost: 5 days.**
  - Login: Create a database to store user progress and achievements, and tailor problems to user's preferences. Store locally on SQLite, and remotely on MongoDB to allow user to practice from multiple devices.
  - Sign Up: If the user is not signed in, allow them to sign up and store their credentials in the local/remote database.
